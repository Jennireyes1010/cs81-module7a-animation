A part of the code that was confusing was the setInterval function, it was hard to understand it since it keeps running nonstop. It made more sense when I understood the clearInterval function and how it works to stop the loop when a specific number of cycles were completed. The animation helps visualize asynchronous behavior when it's updating the screen every 500 milliseconds, additionally the loading symbols and background color changing, showing how tasks are repeated in Javascript. I added background colors that represent progress, it is visually engaging and allows users to see activity rather than a blank screen with no clarity.
